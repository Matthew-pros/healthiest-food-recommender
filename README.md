A sophisticated Streamlit-powered AI application that analyzes restaurant menu photos and text to recommend the healthiest food options using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. This application is inspired by the AI-powered "healthiest food recommender" app demonstrated in an Instagram reel by @heysirio (August 13, 2025).

   git push heroku main
   ```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application using one of the methods above
2. Choose your input method:
   - Upload a menu photo, or
   - Enter menu items as text
3. Get AI-powered recommendations with detailed nutritional analysis

### Example Usage Scenarios

#### Photo Upload Method

1. Click "Upload menu photo"
2. Select a clear image of a restaurant menu (see [sample](assets/sample-menu.jpg))
3. Wait for AI analysis and recommendation

#### Text Input Method

1. Enter menu items in the text box, such as:
   ```
   Cheeseburger, Grilled Chicken Salad, French Fries, Caesar Salad
   ```
2. Click "Get Recommendation"
3. Receive detailed analysis and health recommendation

### Sample Output

```
Recommended: Grilled Chicken Salad

Reason: This option provides high-quality protein (25-30g), essential vitamins from leafy greens, and is relatively low in calories (300-400 calories without dressing). The grilled preparation method avoids excess oils, and the vegetables provide fiber, folate, and antioxidants.

Tip: Request dressing on the side and choose vinaigrette over creamy dressings for optimal health benefits.
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

- **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure methods to store sensitive credentials
- **Access Control**: Consider implementing user authentication for production use
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of OpenAI API rate limits and implement appropriate handling
- **Data Privacy**: User-uploaded images are processed but not stored permanently
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Input Validation**: The app includes built-in input validation and sanitization

## üéØ Customization Ideas

- Add order confirmation simulation after recommendation
- Implement user preferences (dietary restrictions, allergies)
- Add nutritional database integration for more detailed analysis
- Include meal planning and tracking features
- Add multiple language support for international users
- Implement user feedback and rating system
- Add export functionality for recommendations
- Include calorie tracking and daily nutrition goals
